# Design Notes

## Input Conditioning
Initial testing showed ±13 V swings caused op-amp clipping. Added resistor divider (e.g., 1.8k & 10k) to scale to ±11 V. Verified op-amp remained linear with new setup.

## Multiplexer Behavior
DG408 switching time measured at ~250 ns. ADC sampling across 8 channels at 500 Hz achievable.

## ADC Comparison
ESP32 internal ADC showed noise and offset drift. ADS1115 preferred for accuracy, but limits speed to ~860 SPS.

## Issues & Experiments
- TL072 input headroom error in early design — corrected by adjusting divider
- ESP32 ADC tested with averaging — improved stability
