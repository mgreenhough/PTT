# Peripheral Serial Emulator (PSE) - Universal Remote PTT

A hardware-based peripheral designed to universally learn and emulate RS-232/TTL/UART serial commands enabling remote PTT capabilities to be used with consumer UHF/CB radios. 

Used for decades in the aviation industry, remote Push To Talk (PTT) switches have enabled pilots to maintain command of critical flight controls whilst also maintaining critical communication with air traffic control and other aircraft in their vicinity. Machine operators are often manipulating as many and in some cases, more controls but as yet, have had to STOP operating in most cases to transmit on their radio.

Communication is increasingly the most important factor influencing safety, coordination and production on busy sites. The unintended consequence of this though, is the increasingly burdensome requirement for operators to stop what they are doing to do something as simple as transmit a message like "OK", "You're clear to pass" or "I'll be over there in a minute". Whilst this sounds innocuous, the sometimes near constant interruptions can add up to serious production losses. Not to mention the safety implications when operators become increasingly reluctant to respond or in some cases, turn their radios off completely. This can cause cumulative culture creep away from critical safety conscious practices. Having remote PTT functionality enables operators to stay connected without compromise, adds greatly their comfort and makes them safer and more productive.

Enhanced safety: Operators keep their hands on controls, reducing risks during critical tasks.

Improved productivity: No need to pause work to transmit messages, saving time and reducing downtime.

Better communication: Easier, more natural radio use encourages consistent contact and situational awareness.

## Features
- Can be used across multiple radios with the ability to save a radios "profile" and plug & play in seconds
- Unique "learning" feature emulates serial commands up to 115200 baud
- ±15 V tolerant inputs with reverse polarity, over voltage and over current protection
- Intuitive GUI accessible via locally hosted wifi hot spot and available without internet or cellular network connection
- Compatible with "traditional" style handpiece's that use a simple grounded pin for PTT
- Inbuilt debug 8 channel bipolar voltage analyser and UART detector operating on separate core
- Provide use and productivity statistics through the GUI

## Who is it for?
- Earthmovers
- Heavy equipment operators
- Road crews
- Farm machinery operators
- Anyone who uses a UFH/CB radio and had their hands occupied with machine controls

## How it works
- The PSE PTT is connected in between a UHF/CB radio and it's handpiece using RJ45 connectors
- Mode switch is used to select "Learn"
- It is powered by USB or 12v
- User connects to devices WIFI hotspot: Device - PTT, Password - PTT
- User scans QR code on device or opens browser and navigates to IP (X)
- User follows provided instructions and GUI prompts to learn devices PTT
- User changes mode switch to run
