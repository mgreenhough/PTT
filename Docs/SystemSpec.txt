# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Project Name
Peripheral Serial Emulator

## Purpose
To provide a configurable hardware emulator that mimics the behavior of UART-based devices for development and testing.

## Target Users
- Embedded developers
- Hardware QA testers
- System integrators

## Functional Requirements
- Simulate basic serial communication at common baud rates (9600–115200)
- Handle ±15 V inputs safely via op-amp conditioning
- Visualize live input voltage on a mobile interface
- Switch between emulated devices or states via button or host command
- Use ESP32 ADC or ADS1115 for analog sampling

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Real-time response under 10 ms for mode switching
- Modular hardware interface (pluggable or configurable via jumpers)
- Mobile-friendly display output (e.g. BLE, UART-to-phone)

## Constraints
- MCU: ESP32 or ATmega328P
- Power: ±15 V available, with onboard regulation
- Size: Small enclosure-friendly PCB

## Future Ideas
- BLE configuration interface
- EEPROM config presets
- Protocol sniffing / logging mode
